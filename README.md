# KeygenMe V7

This repository contains the source code of my KeygenMe V7 challenge which was originally published on 19th August 2014. The KeygenMe uses method hooking, self-modifying code and other small anti-debugging techniques as protection. The original binary from 2014 can be found in the bin directory.
